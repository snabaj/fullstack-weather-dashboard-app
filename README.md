# Full-stack Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

In this project, I create a full stack weather dashboard application. The application allows users to view current weather and forecasts for any given city. The application calls the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and renders the data in the browser. The project demonstrates full stack development focusing on API integration and data rendering. Languages used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node JS, Express JS and Dotenv for backend development.
